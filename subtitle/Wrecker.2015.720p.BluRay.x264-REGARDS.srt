1
00:00:32,854 --> 00:00:34,357
You all right, Frank?

2
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:39,881
It's gonna be one hell of a blister.

3
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,086
Well, how does it look?

4
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:44,805
Not good.

5
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:48,449
Engine's cooked.

6
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:01,569
- You making the call?
- Yes.

7
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:04,361
But it would help if I could get
some reception.

8
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:18,235
Shit.

9
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,574
You remember what that station attendant
called this stretch of road here?

10
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:31,419
He called it Devil's Pass, Frank. Why?

11
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,144
I'm having the best time.

12
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:18,327
Leslie, pace yourself.
We're just starting out.

13
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,728
I know. We're just starting
and already I feel so great.

14
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:22,551
Come on.

15
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:24,502
- Here, have it.
- No.

16
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:27,092
Do you want to drive?

17
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:30,801
Never mind.

18
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:38,282
- Em, slow down, slow down.
- Why? What?

19
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,068
Oh, he's so cute.

20
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:44,675
- Can we pick him up?
- No! We are not picking anybody up.

21
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:47,662
Leslie, don't!

22
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:51,470
This road is, like, it's a magnet
for serial killers. You know that?

23
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,171
Oh, my God. Really?

24
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:59,208
No, I just made it up, but what
would you have done if he was?

25
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:01,383
Slit his throat first.

26
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:06,948
- Jesus, Leslie. Did I just hear you right?
- I need a beer.

27
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:11,063
Oh, come on. Don't... don't do that!

28
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:14,235
Hey, chill out. No need for the drama.

29
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:16,676
There is no drama. I am driving.

30
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:19,044
- You want to die?
- No. I don't want to die.

31
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:22,051
No, neither do I.
My life is extremely valuable to me.

32
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:25,123
- And I... are you even listening?
- Of course I am.

33
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,441
Hey, Jim.

34
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:29,317
Yeah, it's Leslie.

35
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:31,520
Yeah, Emily's driving.

36
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:36,096
I don't... hold on. I'll ask.
What was the excuse you gave, again?

37
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:40,159
That I was visiting my sister in
Sacramento for a few days. What else?

38
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:44,669
Did you get that? I know. I cannot believe
she's going through with this either.

39
00:05:44,746 --> 00:05:46,941
It's like we have the old Emily back.

40
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:50,748
We've got like two bags of weed,
some tequila, some rum...

41
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:53,883
...some gin and two cases of beer?

42
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,329
Yeah, the way you're going,
we're almost out of beer.

43
00:06:00,357 --> 00:06:02,714
Well, see you guys in a couple of hours.

44
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,529
And will you say "hey" to Dick for me?

45
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:09,945
Rick, Dick, whatever. Just tell him
we look forward to seeing him.

46
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,488
Jim? Hello. Hello? Hello?

47
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,919
Lost our reception.

48
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:19,765
I just want to get there already!

49
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:22,355
Who's Dick?

50
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,076
Who's Dick?

51
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:56,052
- Just the guy you're gonna fuck.
- Excuse me?

52
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:57,811
I know that there's
this little complication...

53
00:06:57,888 --> 00:07:01,938
No, Randy is no complication.
Okay? He's my boyfriend.

54
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:06,228
I feel real shitty about
lying to him about this trip.

55
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:09,744
- What if he finds out?
- Who cares? Payback's a bitch.

56
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:12,784
No, there's not gonna be any payback, Leslie.

57
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:15,088
I still care for him.

58
00:07:16,123 --> 00:07:20,108
And I'm not just gonna fuck some stranger
to satisfy my own insecurities.

59
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,202
Why not? He did.

60
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:28,842
I guess that's why you're
still wearing the bracelet.

61
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,011
You're so damn trusting, Em.

62
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:49,446
Because my gut's telling me
that this guy does not deserve you.

63
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:52,902
You really believe that?

64
00:07:57,938 --> 00:08:00,069
You know what? Things'll change.

65
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,581
I just... I have to toughen up
a little. That's all.

66
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:08,667
My advice, toughen up a lot.

67
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:11,967
Oh, my God! Stop!

68
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,597
What? What?

69
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:22,166
Yeah, I think we go left here.

70
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:24,252
You think?

71
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:27,677
What does the GPS say?

72
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:30,649
I don't know. The stupid thing
stopped working hours ago.

73
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:33,370
This fucking piece of shit.

74
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,139
Come on.

75
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:44,408
It'll be an adventure if we're wrong.

76
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,447
Fuck it.

77
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,421
Oh, God!

78
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:22,169
Diesel exhaust is the worst.

79
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:32,369
- Has this guy never heard of climate change?
- Obviously not.

80
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:40,274
Come on, what's his deal?
Why doesn't he just move over for us?

81
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,671
Come on, asshole! We don't have all day!

82
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,941
So what are you waiting for, girl? Pass him.

83
00:12:17,242 --> 00:12:19,887
It's too risky, I'll take him at the summit.

84
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:07,372
Great. We need gas.

85
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:09,761
Oh, good, because I have to fucking pee.

86
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,583
That's quite the beast?

87
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,758
- Yeah.
- Nice car.

88
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:08,965
- Thank you.
- Fill 'er up for you?

89
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:11,170
Yeah. Yes, please.

90
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:18,882
I'm dyin' to see what you got under the hood.
Check your oil for you?

91
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,704
Knock yourself out.

92
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:28,158
Reception.

93
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:34,866
<i>Hello.</i>

94
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,791
- Jill?
- <i>It is. Who's this?</i>

95
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:39,013
It's Emily.

96
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,430
<i>Oh, hey there, Emily.
Sorry, I didn't recognize your voice.</i>

97
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:46,842
- Is Randy there?
- <i>Yes, just a second.</i>

98
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,179
- <i>Hey, Em, how's your trip going?</i>
- What is she doing there?

99
00:14:53,256 --> 00:14:54,714
<i>You knew I was working from home.</i>

100
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,849
You didn't answer my question.
What's she doing?

101
00:14:57,926 --> 00:15:01,384
<i>Jill was kind enough to bring over some files
that I needed from the office.</i>

102
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:03,465
They couldn't be couriered?

103
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:05,560
<i>They could have, I suppose.</i>

104
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:08,503
Oh, man. You know
how I feel about that woman.

105
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,445
How would you like it
if one of my co-workers...

106
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:13,367
...tried to bone me
at one of my office parties?

107
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:17,289
<i>I wouldn't. I just don't know
why you keep bringing it up.</i>

108
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:20,405
Because you did nothing to discourage it.

109
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:22,483
<i>So what are you saying?</i>

110
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:29,970
- <i>Are you still there?</i>
- You're right.

111
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:33,874
Of course, you're right. I need to stop
blaming you for my insecurities.

112
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:37,510
I'll... just need to toughen up a little.

113
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:41,102
- A lot.
- <i>Well, that would be a good start.</i>

114
00:15:47,274 --> 00:15:48,789
<i>Em?</i>

115
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:51,371
<i>You know I love you, right?</i>

116
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:08,236
You called him, didn't you?

117
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,187
Yeah.

118
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:12,200
What am I gonna do with you?

119
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:17,256
Tell me more about Dick.

120
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:21,252
I knew you'd come around.
He's so hot. You're gonna love him.

121
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:28,604
Oh, I think his name is... Rick?

122
00:16:34,512 --> 00:16:36,611
- How much do I owe you?
- $38.50, ma'am.

123
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:39,072
But you're a little low on oil.

124
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:45,184
I think we should leave now, before
you-know-who gets back on the road.

125
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:48,735
Good idea. I'll fill 'er up at the next stop.

126
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:53,115
Suit yourself. Just don't wait too long.
You might end up thrashing the engine.

127
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:16,633
What's going on?

128
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:20,156
Oh, my God, watch out!

129
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:23,257
Just move. Move, asshole.

130
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,248
What?

131
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,440
Can you believe this guy?

132
00:19:01,093 --> 00:19:04,928
Well, what are you waiting for, Em?
Pass him before he changes his mind.

133
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:14,539
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

134
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,676
He's... he did that on purpose?

135
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:21,331
He's... he's trying to fucking kill us.

136
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:23,217
That other car, too.

137
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:27,121
What is with him? We passed him
a couple of fucking times...

138
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:28,944
...and he goes flying off the fucking hanger!

139
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:32,362
He's got to be fuckin' crazy. He's gotta be.
No one else would fucking act like this.

140
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,632
Hey, fuck this. It's either his job
or our lives. Speed up, Em.

141
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,819
I want you to read off the numbers
on the back of the truck there.

142
00:19:48,152 --> 00:19:50,719
- Five-five-five...
- Yeah.

143
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,975
- One-two...
- Yeah.

144
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:55,019
Six-five.

145
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:58,005
Fuck! There's no service.

146
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:09,845
I can't take the smell.

147
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:17,541
Time to leave this guy in the dust.

148
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:25,093
Idiot!

149
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,909
- "Idiot"? Is that what you got, Em?
- What else do you want me to say?

150
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:30,280
Fuck you, you fuckin' asshole!

151
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:33,367
Don't do that again.

152
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:34,750
What?

153
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:59,552
Hey, sit back. Relax. Enjoy the ride.

154
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:01,822
Smooth sailing from here on.

155
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:13,055
Wake me when we get to Palm Springs.

156
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:14,876
Come on.

157
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,195
Don't get too comfortable.

158
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,312
Just pass.

159
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,634
What the hell is he trying to prove?

160
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:42,514
No idea.

161
00:23:19,236 --> 00:23:23,353
This is a joke, right? This has gotta be some
fucking sick fucking perverted joke, right?

162
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:25,656
Because what else could this
fucking be, you fuckin' asshole?

163
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:28,056
Stop yelling, okay? Stop yelling.

164
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:31,094
It's not helping. Just please, sit there.

165
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:33,364
Let me handle this, okay?

166
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:36,928
Yeah, fine. Handle it.

167
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:52,754
- I was right, wasn't I?
- Yeah. It's just a joke.

168
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:56,476
This is one big fucking joke,
you fucking asshole!

169
00:23:58,364 --> 00:24:00,528
Easy. Easy, Em.

170
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,353
I got this. I got it, I got it.
Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!

171
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:17,513
Easy, easy.

172
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,776
Fuck you!

173
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:48,804
Last we see of him.

174
00:24:50,994 --> 00:24:52,803
Way to go, Em.

175
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:24,962
Don't let him catch up to us.
Just go. Drive, drive.

176
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,738
He's gonna fucking kill us, Em.

177
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:41,054
Brace yourself.

178
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,899
Oh, fuck.

179
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:04,610
Come on.

180
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:08,536
- No reception.
- Yeah.

181
00:26:09,478 --> 00:26:11,223
Come on.

182
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:16,710
- Fuck!
- Hey.

183
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:19,701
We're still alive, okay?

184
00:26:20,642 --> 00:26:22,387
We're still alive.

185
00:26:46,495 --> 00:26:49,311
I walk like that after
a night of heavy poundin'.

186
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:52,434
Yeah, we're just in
a little discomfort, that's all.

187
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:54,546
Nothing a few painkillers can't cure.

188
00:26:54,622 --> 00:26:56,715
Oh, I know all about discomfort, sweetie.

189
00:26:56,792 --> 00:27:01,074
You try working this joint with these
God-awful corns I got growin' on my toes.

190
00:27:02,877 --> 00:27:04,398
Take your order?

191
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:10,768
Let's just make that two coffees, please.

192
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:13,295
Two it is. I will come back for your orders.

193
00:27:13,372 --> 00:27:15,247
And a fork you can eat with.

194
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:16,859
Thank you.

195
00:27:27,928 --> 00:27:29,708
He's back.

196
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,746
- What?
- No, no, don't.

197
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:34,264
I just said he's back.

198
00:27:34,341 --> 00:27:38,344
- His truck's parked out there in the lot.
- But he fucking left.

199
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:41,704
We saw him, we saw him leave.
Why would he come back for us...

200
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,263
- ...what does he want from us?
- I've got no idea, just...

201
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,684
...just be quiet while I try
and figure out who it is.

202
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:23,491
Him.

203
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:28,664
I'm not sure,
but there are two possibilities.

204
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:32,795
Two possibilities? We shouldn't even be
here. I want to get back on the road...

205
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:36,451
Save it, sweetie,
ain't got no reception around here.

206
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:40,393
I know that. Do you have a house
phone maybe that we could use?

207
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,402
Well, you could, but it ain't working.

208
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:45,557
Of course it's not working,
because nothing works in this shithole.

209
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,028
Excuse me?

210
00:28:47,104 --> 00:28:49,715
Can I get a soup in a cup or a bowl?

211
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:51,698
Heather, hold up.

212
00:28:51,775 --> 00:28:54,098
You know what?
We will just have two cheeseburgers.

213
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:55,887
How does that sound, Leslie?

214
00:28:57,661 --> 00:29:01,391
- Two cheeseburgers? Anything else?
- No, thank you. That'll be all.

215
00:29:01,468 --> 00:29:04,462
By the way, just a little further up the
road, there's a rest stop by the summit...

216
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:09,129
- ...you might get some reception up there.
- We'll try there. Thank you.

217
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:12,695
You need to tone it down a notch.

218
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,881
Look, it's almost noon.

219
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:23,528
This is probably the only diner
around for miles.

220
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,036
Probably comes here all the time to eat.

221
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:28,775
May be he was just going
too fast down the hill...

222
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:34,083
...he had to slow down,
just turned around, and... that's all.

223
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,660
- That's all.
- I think we should leave.

224
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:41,540
That way if he follows us
we'll know his true intentions.

225
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:44,675
And then what? We're right back
to where we started.

226
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:47,586
Look, it's fine. The Mustang,
it's powerful enough, no problems there...

227
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:50,305
...but there's no way I'm gonna continue
driving at the speeds we're going...

228
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:53,914
- ...it's way too fucking dangerous.
- Okay, we'll talk to him then.

229
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:56,701
To who, Leslie? Which one?

230
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:01,278
Look, let's just sit here.

231
00:30:01,643 --> 00:30:04,924
Be patient. We'll figure it out soon enough.

232
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:21,806
Two cheeseburgers.

233
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,876
Oh, my God, he's leaving.

234
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:32,120
Tell me when he's out the door.

235
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:39,529
Now.

236
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,916
It's not him.

237
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:04,313
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

238
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:13,393
- Okay.
- May I help you?

239
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:15,792
Stop it.

240
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:18,577
What?

241
00:31:19,037 --> 00:31:21,168
You know what I'm talking about.

242
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:25,005
- No, I don't. I don't have a fucking clue.
- I'll call the police!

243
00:31:26,682 --> 00:31:28,718
Don't play dumb with me.

244
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:32,647
You have been harassing us...
no, terrorizing us... long enough.

245
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,843
Just leave us alone.

246
00:31:42,456 --> 00:31:46,610
- You got some serious issues, girl.
- Oh, I've got issues? I've got issues?

247
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,155
Emily!

248
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:51,976
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Stop him, he's gonna kill her!

249
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:56,364
Let her go. You made your point,
what more can you do?

250
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,819
- Oh, God.
- You're not doing it here.

251
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:02,918
Just keep that crazy bitch away from me.

252
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:08,039
- I think you two better go.
- Okay.

253
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:10,055
Emily, what just got into you?

254
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:12,517
You said I should get tougher.

255
00:32:12,594 --> 00:32:14,405
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

256
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:16,642
Wait here, I'll get our stuff.

257
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,246
Stop, you fucking coward!

258
00:33:23,922 --> 00:33:26,078
Show yourself, you coward!

259
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:33,148
- Leslie.
- What?

260
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:56,571
No.

261
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:02,827
- Shit, there's no way.
- God, no.

262
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:05,594
There's no way.
This is... this is impossible.

263
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:09,399
Please don't let it be him. Please don't
let it be him. Please don't let it be him.

264
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:15,139
Oh, my God. We need to loosen up.

265
00:35:26,882 --> 00:35:29,237
Holy fuck! Some actual courtesy.

266
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:35,955
- That tow truck could learn from this guy.
- No kidding.

267
00:35:39,174 --> 00:35:41,042
Thanks, man.

268
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,927
That's how it's done.

269
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:24,959
This is crazy.

270
00:36:32,554 --> 00:36:33,876
Oh, God.

271
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,538
That is the craziest thing I ever...

272
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:56,970
- Where's the driver?
- There is no driver.

273
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:58,890
- We've been having these problems...
- Back it up.

274
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,248
Your car, back it up. We need to clear this
bridge before somebody else comes along.

275
00:37:02,325 --> 00:37:06,243
Park it over there by mine. You see
somebody else coming, you scream. Loud.

276
00:37:08,212 --> 00:37:10,009
Get in, I'll push.

277
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,651
Hey, the steering wheel's locked!

278
00:37:24,524 --> 00:37:26,003
Look.

279
00:37:27,313 --> 00:37:29,145
See if it'll turn over first.

280
00:37:32,943 --> 00:37:35,328
It was worth a shot, anyway.

281
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:53,995
- Park it. Hand brake!
- What?

282
00:37:55,947 --> 00:37:58,364
- Hand brake.
- I can't hear you.

283
00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:05,998
What?

284
00:38:06,507 --> 00:38:09,980
We're in luck. This tow truck driver
said he'll give us a hand.

285
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:26,557
Damn.

286
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:29,273
Damn.

287
00:38:48,135 --> 00:38:49,928
What are you playing at?

288
00:38:52,453 --> 00:38:54,199
Get in.

289
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:58,294
Go. Go!

290
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:05,046
What the fuck's going on? Who is that guy?

291
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:08,238
If I were you, I would get out of here
before he tries to come for you too.

292
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:31,668
Oh, my God.

293
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,780
- Oh, God.
- He's coming!

294
00:39:33,857 --> 00:39:36,178
What do you fucking want from us?

295
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,462
Fuck.

296
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:15,123
All right.

297
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,449
Yeah. Try to keep up at this speed, asshole.

298
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:29,135
You're no match for this this fucking car.

299
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:54,090
Oh, my God.

300
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:02,957
Oh, my God!

301
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,482
The doors! Lock the fucking doors!

302
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:28,263
This is fucking insanity.

303
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:32,662
Can you change a flat?

304
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:41,156
Come on.

305
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:46,466
Fuck!

306
00:41:47,248 --> 00:41:50,109
- How are you making out?
- This one's too tight.

307
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:53,090
- Let me try.
- No, keep your eyes on the road.

308
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,711
Come on, you little fucker. Come on!

309
00:41:57,645 --> 00:41:59,169
Yes!

310
00:41:59,246 --> 00:42:02,318
I did it! I actually did it!

311
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:06,525
We gotta go.

312
00:42:14,761 --> 00:42:16,283
Run!

313
00:43:23,177 --> 00:43:24,635
Leslie!

314
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,329
Leslie!

315
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,860
Fucking asshole, don't you dare
fucking hurt her. Don't hurt her.

316
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:25,880
Oh, come on! Give me some reception.

317
00:44:26,244 --> 00:44:29,302
Give me some fucking reception.
Please give me some reception.

318
00:44:39,362 --> 00:44:43,443
How much longer? How much longer?
Goddamn it, how much longer?

319
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,314
Slow down. Slow down.

320
00:45:46,398 --> 00:45:50,447
Please do the right thing, please,
I am begging you. Please let her go.

321
00:45:55,228 --> 00:45:56,750
Leslie!

322
00:45:58,075 --> 00:45:59,822
Leslie, are you in there?

323
00:46:05,706 --> 00:46:07,228
Leslie!

324
00:46:14,185 --> 00:46:17,307
Please, I just want to know if she's safe.

325
00:46:24,217 --> 00:46:27,689
Wait! Don't go! I just want to...

326
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:33,235
You son of a bitch, this isn't a game!

327
00:46:33,311 --> 00:46:36,552
Please! Son of a bitch,
this isn't a fucking game!

328
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:39,014
I just want to know if she's safe!

329
00:46:51,283 --> 00:46:52,486
Fuck!

330
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:56,709
I just want to know if she's safe,
you fucking asshole!

331
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,627
Fuck!

332
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:43,103
What? Oh, shit!

333
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:56,136
That's it.

334
00:48:56,213 --> 00:48:58,365
Keep going, you fuckin' creep.

335
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:11,259
Come on, please give me
some fucking reception.

336
00:49:25,544 --> 00:49:27,709
Something fucking work!

337
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:29,914
Fuck!

338
00:49:32,743 --> 00:49:35,097
I cannot believe this.

339
00:49:44,422 --> 00:49:46,584
Hold it together, Emily.

340
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:02,076
Fuck this.

341
00:50:05,283 --> 00:50:08,535
I'm gonna sit here and wait...

342
00:50:08,612 --> 00:50:10,953
...until it is safe to go for help.

343
00:50:32,577 --> 00:50:35,267
Open the fucking door, Emily! Open it!

344
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:39,156
- You fucking bitch!
- What?

345
00:50:39,233 --> 00:50:41,522
- You left me there to die!
- No, I didn't!

346
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,267
- I didn't! I swear I thought he took you!
- Bullshit! You left me with that monster!

347
00:50:45,344 --> 00:50:49,586
No! Please, please, believe me!
I swear! I'm sorry!

348
00:50:49,663 --> 00:50:51,407
I swear!

349
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,798
I'm so sorry.

350
00:50:57,851 --> 00:50:59,309
Yeah.

351
00:51:00,346 --> 00:51:01,867
Leslie...

352
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:05,516
...how did you get here so fast?

353
00:51:08,218 --> 00:51:10,069
I hitched a ride.

354
00:51:11,801 --> 00:51:13,547
With who?

355
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,803
Who do you think?

356
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:35,014
No, I... I gave you the road.

357
00:53:56,112 --> 00:53:57,601
What?

358
00:54:09,903 --> 00:54:14,248
Oh, my God! Oh, my fucking God!
Thank you, thank you, God. Thank you.

359
00:54:14,325 --> 00:54:17,665
Thank you, God. Thank God you're here.

360
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:19,693
Thank you.

361
00:54:21,835 --> 00:54:25,054
Thank God you're here. Thank God.
I thought you were him. I honestly thought...

362
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,764
Ma'am, please, I just need you
to get back in the car.

363
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:29,565
What? No...

364
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:32,763
Officer, I need help. I need help!

365
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,972
Driver's license and registration, please.

366
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,979
No, you don't understand.

367
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:40,794
He took my friend and he is coming for me!

368
00:54:42,118 --> 00:54:44,313
Who? Who's coming for you?

369
00:54:44,908 --> 00:54:46,648
I don't know.

370
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:50,069
He drives a tow truck
and he wants to kill me.

371
00:54:53,314 --> 00:54:55,125
He had to have passed you.

372
00:54:55,202 --> 00:54:57,237
He... he had to.

373
00:54:57,889 --> 00:55:00,660
No, someone is chasing me, Officer.

374
00:55:00,737 --> 00:55:02,291
I swear.

375
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:05,168
Ma'am, please, just get back in the car.

376
00:55:10,046 --> 00:55:11,983
I just need you to get in the car.

377
00:55:26,809 --> 00:55:28,957
I know this sounds crazy.
It sounds fucking crazy to me too...

378
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,307
Driver's license and registration, please.

379
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:34,957
I am not making this up.

380
00:55:36,089 --> 00:55:37,610
I'm not.

381
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:44,027
There was a tow truck.
The driver, he took my friend Leslie.

382
00:55:44,535 --> 00:55:47,306
He took my friend Leslie,
and I think he killed her.

383
00:55:47,382 --> 00:55:50,569
Certain he killed her. And now...
now he wants to kill me.

384
00:55:50,646 --> 00:55:53,518
He wants to kill me,
because I am the only witness.

385
00:55:53,595 --> 00:55:54,715
Where are my fucking papers?

386
00:55:54,792 --> 00:55:57,126
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to settle down.

387
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:01,830
Sure. Sure, I'll settle down.

388
00:56:01,907 --> 00:56:03,877
I'm not making this up.

389
00:56:08,977 --> 00:56:10,627
Come on.

390
00:56:12,464 --> 00:56:15,012
Fuck, it's in here. Here!

391
00:56:15,856 --> 00:56:18,017
Yeah, here! Here they are.

392
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,064
Oh, God.

393
00:57:07,274 --> 00:57:08,670
Here.

394
00:57:08,746 --> 00:57:10,269
Hello?

395
00:57:10,346 --> 00:57:11,997
Hello? Is anybody there?

396
00:57:12,073 --> 00:57:14,556
<i>This is police dispatch. Who am I talking to?</i>

397
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:18,427
Oh, my God, thank you!
I need help! I need help, please!

398
00:57:18,504 --> 00:57:20,280
I need help.

399
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,615
<i>Please respond, ma'am.</i>

400
00:57:28,707 --> 00:57:29,844
No.

401
00:59:21,306 --> 00:59:23,021
What the fuck?

402
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:21,469
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
You gotta be fucking me.

403
01:00:21,546 --> 01:00:23,561
What the fuck do I do?

404
01:00:23,638 --> 01:00:25,990
Just go, just go.

405
01:00:53,491 --> 01:00:54,982
Okay.

406
01:00:55,634 --> 01:00:59,335
It's just us. It's just... us.

407
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:17,764
I need gas. Quick.

408
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,811
- Nah, we're closed.
- What?

409
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,022
Hey...

410
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:25,379
Look, ma'am, look, come on, I don't...
I don't want no trouble here.

411
01:01:25,455 --> 01:01:27,330
- Fill 'er up now!
- All right. All right.

412
01:01:27,407 --> 01:01:29,186
- Do you have a phone?
- Yeah, yeah.

413
01:01:29,263 --> 01:01:31,795
- Where?
- Over there. It's over there.

414
01:01:35,245 --> 01:01:37,825
Oh, thank God. Thank God, thank God.

415
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,809
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

416
01:01:39,886 --> 01:01:41,298
Police, please.

417
01:01:46,283 --> 01:01:47,743
Yes.

418
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:52,126
- Yes, I want to report a tow truck driving...
- <i>Can I have your name, ma'am?</i>

419
01:01:53,992 --> 01:01:57,212
He's taken my friend.
He killed a police officer.

420
01:01:57,289 --> 01:01:59,869
<i>Ma'am, can you calm down? I need your name.</i>

421
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:02,685
My name is Emily. Emily Kirk.

422
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:06,811
- <i>What is your address?</i>
- 1537 Jefferson Boulevard.

423
01:02:07,463 --> 01:02:09,242
Like "Captain."

424
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:11,865
I live in Seattle, Washington.

425
01:02:11,942 --> 01:02:15,607
<i>If you can just stay on the line, ma'am,
we need to verify some information.</i>

426
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,951
Oh, shit.

427
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,516
Oh, shit!

428
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:31,190
What the fuck is going on?

429
01:02:37,152 --> 01:02:39,153
That was my only phone!

430
01:03:18,558 --> 01:03:20,207
All right.

431
01:03:24,572 --> 01:03:27,088
If this is what we need to quit...

432
01:03:27,164 --> 01:03:29,135
...then bring it on.

433
01:03:29,691 --> 01:03:31,436
I'm ready now.

434
01:03:35,128 --> 01:03:36,952
Bring it on.

435
01:03:37,432 --> 01:03:40,362
Bring it on, bitch,
'cause I'm ready for you this time.

436
01:04:17,044 --> 01:04:18,568
No.

437
01:04:19,124 --> 01:04:20,647
No.

438
01:04:21,203 --> 01:04:23,524
No. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

439
01:04:35,217 --> 01:04:36,739
Damn.

440
01:04:43,376 --> 01:04:45,147
Oh, fuck!

441
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,754
Fuck!

442
01:05:05,195 --> 01:05:06,685
Shit!

443
01:06:25,352 --> 01:06:28,269
Where are you now? Where are you?

444
01:06:58,134 --> 01:06:59,382
What?

445
01:07:01,637 --> 01:07:03,767
Oh, my God. No. No more oil.

446
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,198
Okay.

447
01:07:37,906 --> 01:07:39,716
Come on.

448
01:07:53,233 --> 01:07:54,722
Okay.

449
01:08:02,096 --> 01:08:05,803
Oh, fuck! Fuck, come on. Just come on.

450
01:09:08,588 --> 01:09:10,323
You wanna play?

451
01:09:11,209 --> 01:09:12,778
Let's play.

452
01:10:21,575 --> 01:10:24,329
Fuck it. Got no choice.

453
01:10:40,006 --> 01:10:41,879
Come on.

454
01:11:26,979 --> 01:11:28,437
Leslie!

455
01:11:34,098 --> 01:11:35,555
Leslie?

456
01:11:52,031 --> 01:11:53,520
Leslie?

457
01:11:55,966 --> 01:11:57,710
Where is she?

458
01:11:59,099 --> 01:12:00,844
Where is she?

459
01:12:07,514 --> 01:12:09,244
Where is she?

460
01:13:03,283 --> 01:13:04,769
Hello?

461
01:13:37,165 --> 01:13:38,666
Oh, fuck!

462
01:13:44,139 --> 01:13:46,332
Please, Leslie, I'm sorry.

463
01:13:56,344 --> 01:13:58,145
I'm so sorry.

464
01:16:29,024 --> 01:16:30,545
Hello?

465
01:16:32,542 --> 01:16:34,352
Is anybody here?

466
01:16:40,861 --> 01:16:42,350
Hello?

467
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,709
My car is broken.

468
01:17:07,593 --> 01:17:09,788
I could use a little help here.
